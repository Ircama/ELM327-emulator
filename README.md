ELM327-emulator
===============

A Python emulator of the ELM327 OBD-II adapter connected to a vehicle.

*ELM327-emulator* provides a virtual serial communication port to client applications (via [pseudoterminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoterminal) function) and simulates an [ELM327](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELM327) adapter connected to a vehicle through the [OBD-II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-board_diagnostics) protocol. It inludes a command-line interface for extensive monitoring and controlling.

*ELM327-emulator* is agnostic of the client application accessing the serial port and has been tested with [python-OBD](https://github.com/brendanwhitfield/python-OBD).

An internal dictionary (named *ObdMessage*) allows configuring the emulation, which is set to reproduce the message flow generated by a Toyota Auris Hybrid car (through `scenario car` option), including custom PIDs and can be easily configured to statically and dynamically update its dictionary to simulate OBDII answers produced by other vehicles.


# Installation

```shell
# Checking python version (should be 3.6 or higher)
python3.7 -V

# Installing prerequisites
python3.7 -m pip install pyyaml
python3.7 -m pip install obd # this is needed for obd_dictionary.py

# Downloading ELM327-emulator
git clone https://github.com/ircama/ELM327-emulator.git
cd ELM327-emulator
```

# Usage

Run with:

```shell
python3.7 -m elm
```

After starting the program, the emulator is ready to use. To enable the preconfigured set of PIDs of a Toyota Auris Hybrid car, enter `scenario car`.

The application just needs to connect to the virtual device shown by the emulator and interact with the car as if it was accessing a real ELM327 adapter.

All subsequent information are not needed for a basic usage of the tool and allow to master *ELM327-emulator*, exploiting it to test specific features including the simulation of communication exceptions, which are not always easy to be reproduced with a real link.


# Compatibility

ELM327-emulator has been tested with Python 3.6 and 3.7. Python 2 is not supported.

This code needs pseudo-terminal handling (pty support, `import pty`) which is platform dependent and runs on UNIX OSs. With Windows, [cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) is supported.


# Description

The serial port to be used by the application interfacing the emulator is displayed when starting the program. E.g.:

    ELM327-emulator is running on /dev/pts/0

A [dictionary](https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries) named *ObdMessage* is used to define commands and PIDs. The dictionary includes more sections (named scenarios):

- `'AT'`: set of default AT commands
- `'default'`: set of default PIDs
- `'car'`: PIDs of a Toyota Auris Hybrid veichle
- any additional custom section can be used to define specific scenarios

Default settings include both the 'AT' and the 'default' scenarios.

The dictionary used to parse each ELM command is dynamically built as a union of three defined scenarios in the following order: 'default', 'AT', custom scenario (when applied). Each subsequent scenario redefines commands of the previous scenarios. In principle, 'AT' scenario is added to 'default' and, if a custom scenario is used, this is also added on top, and all equal keys are replaced. Then the Priority key defines the precedence to match elements.

If a custom scenario is selected through the *scenario* command, any key defined in the custom scenario replaces the default settings ('AT' and 'default' scenarios).

The key used in the dictionary consists of a unique identifier for each PID. Allowed values for each key (PID):

- `'Request'`: received data; a [regular expression](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) can be used
- `'Descr'`: string describing the PID
- `'Exec'`: command to be executed
- `'Log'`: *logging.debug* argument
- `'ResponseFooter'`: run a function and returns a footer to the response (a [lambda function](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#lambda) can be used)
- `'ResponseHeader'`: run a function and returns a header to the response (a [lambda function](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#lambda) can be used)
- `'Response'`: returned data; can be a string or a list/tuple of strings; if more strings are included, the emulator randomly select one of them each time
- `'Action'`: can be set to 'skip' in order to skip the processing of the PID
- `'Header'`: if set, process the command only if the corresponding header matches
- `'Priority'=number`: when set, the key has higher priority than the default (highest number = 1, lowest = 10 = default)

The emulator provides a monitoring front-end, supporting commands and controlling the backend thread which executes the actual process.

At the `CMD> ` prompt, the emulator accepts the following commands:

- `help` = List available commands (or detailed help with "help cmd").
- `quit` (or end-of-file/Control-D, or break/Control-C) = quit the program
- `counters` = print the number of each executed PIDs (upper case names), the values associated to some 'AT' PIDs (*cmd_...*), the unknown requests, the emulator response delay, the total number of executed commands (*commands*) and the current scenario (*scenario*). The related dictionary is `emulator.counters`.
- `pause` = pause the execution. (Related attribute is `emulator.threadState = THREAD.PAUSED`.)
- `prompt` = toggle prompt off/on
- `resume` = resume the execution after pausing; also prints the used device. (Related attribute is `emulator.threadState = THREAD.ACTIVE`)
- `delay <n>` = delay each emulator response of `<n>` seconds (floating point number; default is 0.5 seconds)
- `wait <n>` = delay the execution of the next command of `<n>` seconds (floating point number; default is 10 seconds)
- `engineoff` = switch to *engineoff* scenario
- `scenario <scenario>` = switch to `<scenario>` scenario; if the scenario is missing or invalid, defaults to `'car'`. The autocompletion (by pressing or double-pressing TAB) allows prompting all compatible scenarios defined in `emulator.ObdMessage`. (Related attribute is `emulator.scenario`.)
- `default` = reset to *default* scenario
- `reset` = reset the emulator (counters and variables)
- `color` = toggle usage of colors off/on
- `history [<n>]` = print the last 20 items of the command history; if an argument is given, print the last n items in the history; with argument *clear*, clears the history.
- `merge <module>` = import a scenario from an external module and merges it with the emulator configuration. `<module>` shall be a python file including the `ObdMessage` dictionary (e.g., generated by *obd_dictionary.py*) without *.py* extension (notice that the physical file shall be in the current directory and shall end with *.py*). The autocompletion allows prompting all compatible files in the current directory (type *merge*, then press space, then press TAB). After a successful merge, the new scenario can be activated through the *scenario* command.

In addition to the previously listed keywords, any Python command is allowed to query/configure the backend thread

At the command prompt, cursors and [keyboard shortcuts](https://github.com/chzyer/readline/blob/master/doc/shortcut.md) are allowed. Autocompletion (via TAB key) is active for all previously described commands and also allows Python keywords and namespaces (built-ins, self and globals). If the autocompletion matches a single item, this is immediately expanded; Conversely, if more possibilities are matched, none of them is returned, but pressing TAB again a list of available options is displayed.

The command prompt also allows configuring the `emulator.answer` dictionary, which has the goal to dynamically redefine answers for specific PIDs (`'Pid': '...'`). Its syntax is:

```python
emulator.answer = { 'pid' : 'answer', 'pid' : 'answer', ... }
```

Example:

```python
emulator.answer = { 'SPEED': 'NO DATA\r', 'RPM': 'NO DATA\r' }
# Or, alternatively:
emulator.answer['SPEED']='NO DATA\r'
emulator.answer['RPM']='NO DATA\r'
```

The above example forces SPEED and RPM PIDs to always return "NO DATA".

To reset the *emulator.answer* string to its default value:

```python
emulator.answer = {}
# Or, alternatively:
del emulator.answer['SPEED']
del emulator.answer['RPM']
```

This dictionary can be used to modify answers within a workflow. The front-end allows implementing basic Python workflows and can also be controlled by an external piped automator.

Example of automation which suspends the emulator for 10 seconds:

```python
emulator.threadState = THREAD.PAUSED; time.sleep(10); emulator.threadState = THREAD.ACTIVE
```

Example of an automation that simulates the off/on ignition states:

```python
CMD> for i in range(10): emulator.scenario="car" if i % 2 else "engineoff"; print(emulator.scenario); time.sleep(10)
engineoff
car
engineoff
car
engineoff
car
engineoff
car
engineoff
car
```

Response strings allow embedding Python statements and expressions. Specifically, `Response`, `ResponseHeader`, `ResponseFooter` and `emulator.answer` support single and multiple in-line Python commands (expressions or statements) when embraced between `\0` tags: this feature for instance can be used to embed real-time delays between strings or to differentiate answers. The return value of a statement is ignored. The evaluation of an expression is substituted. Spaces inside `\0` tags are allowed and can be used to improve readability. Example: `'Response' = 'SEARCHING...\0 time.sleep(1) \0\rUNABLE TO CONNECT\r'`. This returns `SEARCHING...`, then waits one second, then returns `\rUNABLE TO CONNECT\r`. Notice that, as `time.sleep` is a statement, the related return value is ignored.

Further processing can be achieved through a *lambda function* applied to `ResponseHeader`, `ResponseFooter`. It has to manage the following parameters: *self*, *cmd*, *pid*, *val* (e.g., `lambda self, cmd, pid, val:`).

- cmd: the request, received by the client application
- pid: the PID identifier (which can be used as key to index `self.counters` and `ObdMessage`)
- val: `ObdMessage` value related to `pid` (e.g., `val['Response']`).

Example of PID definition within the `ObdMessage` dictionary:

```python
            'ELM_PIDS_A': {
                'Request': '^0100$',
                'Descr': 'PIDS_A',
                'ResponseHeader': \
                lambda self, cmd, pid, val: \
                    'SEARCHING...\0 time.sleep(1) \0\rUNABLE TO CONNECT\r' \
                    if self.counters[pid] == 1 else 'NO DATA\r',
                'Response': '',
                'Priority': 5
            },
```

In the above example, the first time *ResponseHeader* is executed, the produced response is `SEARCHING...`, followed by a one-second delay and then `\rUNABLE TO CONNECT\r`. For all subsequent messages, the response will be different and produces `'NO DATA\r'`.

The ability to add dynamic differentiators and delays within responses enables testing specific use cases and exceptions that are difficult to be achieved through a real connection with a car. These not only apply to the `ObdMessage` dictionary (by editing *elm.py*), but also to `emulator.answer`, that can be configured through the command line. Consider for instance the following dynamic configuration via command line:

```python
emulator.answer['SPEED'] = '\0 self.ECU_R_ADDR_E + " 03 41 0D 0A " if randint(0, 100) > 20 else "NO DATA" \0\r'
```

In the above example, which illustrates an in-line expression substitution, the configuration of the ‘SPEED’ PID is replaced with a dynamic answer and the ‘SPEED’ PID will return `7E8 03 41 0D 0A` + newline for most of the times. With 20% probability, `NO DATA` + newline is returned. Notice that the last `\r` is common to both options. (Notice also that ECU headers shall by referenced within the *self* namespace.)

To list the configuration, type `emulator.answer`, or simply `counters`. To remove the dynamic answer and return to the default configuration of the ‘SPEED’ PID, type `del emulator.answer['SPEED']`.

Logging is controlled through `elm.yaml` file (in the current directory by default). Its path can be set through the *ELM_LOG_CFG* environment variable.

The logging level can be dynamically changed by referencing `emulator.logger`. For instance, if the logging configuration has *stdout* as the first handler (default settings of the provided `elm.yaml` file), the following commands will change the logging level:

```python
emulator.logger.handlers[0].setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
emulator.logger.handlers[0].setLevel(logging.INFO)
emulator.logger.handlers[0].setLevel(logging.WARNING)
emulator.logger.handlers[0].setLevel(logging.ERROR)
emulator.logger.handlers[0].setLevel(logging.CRITICAL)
```

It is possible to add marks in the log file via commands like `emulator.logger.info("my mark")`

Command to count the number of different PIDs (OBD Commands) used by the client (excluding AT Commands):
```python
import re
from functools import reduce
reduce(lambda x, key: x + (1 if re.match('^[A-Z]', key) and not key.startswith('AT_') and emulator.counters[key] > 0 else 0), emulator.counters, 0)
```

The following command returns the total number of OBD Commands (PID queries issued by the client excluding AT Commands):
```python
import re
from functools import reduce
reduce(lambda x, key: x + (emulator.counters[key] if re.match('^[A-Z]', key) and not key.startswith('AT_') else 0), emulator.counters, 0)
```

To only count AT Commands:
```python
from functools import reduce
reduce(lambda x, key: x + (emulator.counters[key] if key.startswith('AT_') else 0), emulator.counters, 0)
```

To save a CSV file including the *emulator.counters* dictionary:
```python
with open('mycounters.txt', 'w') as f: f.write('\r\n'.join([x + ', ' + repr(emulator.counters[x]) for x in emulator.counters]))
```

## ObdMessage Dictionary Generator for "ELM327-emulator" (obd_dictionary) ##

*obd_dictionary* is a dictionary generator for "ELM327-emulator".

It queries the vehicle via python-OBD for all available command and is also able to process custom PIDs described in [Torque CSV files](https://torque-bhp.com/wiki/PIDs).

Its output is a python *ObdMessage* dictionary that can be added to the *elm.py* program of *ELM327-emulator*, so that the emulator will be able to provide the same commands returned by the car.

Notice that querying the vehicle might be invasive and some commands can change the car configuration (enabling or disabling belts alarm, enabling or disabling reverse beeps, clearing diagnostic codes, controlling fans, etc.). In order to prevent dangerous PIDs to be used for building the dictionary, a PID blacklist can be edited in elm.py. To check all PIDs without performing actual OBDII queries, use the `-p 0` option (the standard error output with default logging level shows the list of produced PIDs).

```
usage: obd_dictionary.py [-h] -i DEVICE [-c [CSV_FILE]] [-o [FILE]] [-v] [-V]
                         [-p PROBES] [-d DELAY] [-D DELAY_COMMANDS]
                         [-n CAR_NAME] [-b] [-m]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

                        input csv file including custom PIDs (Torque CSV
                        Format: https://torque-bhp.com/wiki/PIDs) '-' reads
                        data from the standard input

                        output dictionary file generated after processing
                        input data (replaced if existing). Default is to print
                        data to the standard output

                        number of probes (each probe includes querying all
                        PIDs to the OBDII adapter)

                        delay (in seconds) between probes
  -D DELAY_COMMANDS, --delay_commands DELAY_COMMANDS
                        delay (in seconds) between each PID query within all

                        name of the car (dictionary label; default is "car")
  -b, --blacklist       include blacklisted PIDs within probes
  -m, --missing         add in-line comment to dictionary for PIDs with
                        missing response
```

Sample usage: `obd_dictionary.py -i /dev/ttyUSB0 -c car.csv -o ObdMessage.py -v -p 10 -d 1 -n mycar`

The file produced by *obd_dictionary.py* can be dynamically imported in *ELM327-emulator* through the `merge` command, which loads an *ObdMessage* dictionary and merges it with *emulator.ObdMessage*. Example:

```python
# Create AurisOutput.py
python3 obd_dictionary.py -i /dev/ttyUSB0 -c auris.csv -o AurisOutput.py -n Auris
python3 -m elm # run ELM327-emulator
merge AurisOutput
scenario Auris
```

To help configuring the emulator, autocompletion is allowed (by pressing TAB) when prompting the `merge` command, including the `merge` argument. Also variables and keywords like `scenario` accept autocompletion, including the `scenario` argument.

A merged scenario can be removed via `del emulator.ObdMessage['<name of the scenario to be removed>']`.
