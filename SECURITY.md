# ELM327-emulator Security Policy

*ELM327-emulator* is a testing software which is not expected to run in production environments. Considering that the dictionary allows executing user-defined commands,
it is important to revise any third-party customization to avoid that security flaws are introduced.

Security bugs will be taken seriously and,
if confirmed upon investigation, a new patch will be released within a reasonable amount of time, including a security bulletin and the credit to the discoverer.

Warning: when using the TCP/IP networking, the INET socket is bound to all interfaces.

## Reporting a Security Bug

The way to report a security bug is to open an [issue](https://github.com/Ircama/ELM327-emulator/issues) including related information
(e.g., reproduction steps, version).
